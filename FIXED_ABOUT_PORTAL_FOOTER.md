# Fixed: Footer "About the Portal" Link Issue

## Issue Description
The footer section had an "About the Portal" option that was redirecting to scroll up for all pages instead of opening the about section with page information.

## Problem
- The "About the Portal" link in the footer was set to `href="#"` which only scrolls to the top of the page
- Users expected this link to show information about SaralSeva portal
- The About page component already existed but wasn't properly linked

## Solution
Updated the Footer component to properly link to the About page instead of just scrolling to the top.

## Changes Made

### File: `user/src/components/pages/Footer.jsx`
**Before:**
```javascript
{ name: "About the Portal", href: "#" },
```

**After:**
```javascript
{ name: "About the Portal", href: "/about" },
```

## Technical Details

### Components Involved
1. **Footer Component** (`user/src/components/pages/Footer.jsx`)
   - Contains the footer navigation links
   - Updated the "About the Portal" link destination

2. **About Component** (`user/src/components/pages/About.jsx`)
   - Already existed with proper content about SaralSeva
   - Displays mission, objectives, and information about the portal

3. **App Routing** (`user/src/App.jsx`)
   - Already had the `/about` route properly configured
   - Route: `<Route path='/about' element={<About/>}/>`

### Verification
- ✅ User section footer now properly navigates to About page
- ✅ Employee section doesn't have a footer (uses different layout structure)
- ✅ About page displays comprehensive information about SaralSeva
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Result
- Users can now click "About the Portal" in the footer to view detailed information about SaralSeva
- The About page shows:
  - Mission statement
  - Portal objectives
  - Information about the Ministry of Panchayati Raj initiative
  - Professional layout with images and proper styling

## Files Modified
- `user/src/components/pages/Footer.jsx` - Updated link destination

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- `user/src/components/pages/About.jsx` - Already properly implemented
- `user/src/App.jsx` - Route already configured
- `employee/` section - No footer component present
